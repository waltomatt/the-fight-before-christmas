# the-stress-before-christmas
For this piece of university coursework, we had to implement part of a SoC display unit in Verilog and write a test
bench for it. I chose one of the most simple units (a rectangle), but then I wrote a node program to convert a bitmap image into a series of rectangles that got inserted into a (stupidy long - see image.s) ARM source file which was loaded onto a chip connected to the FPGA so that I could display a festive image :)
